Backend Integration for Edit Functionality
I'll implement backend integration for the Edit button to fetch supply chain data and update form fields automatically.

Step-by-step solution:
Create a new endpoint in the backend to fetch ingredient details
Update the IngredientList component to make API calls when the Edit button is clicked
Implement data fetching and form field updates when editing starts
main.py

IngredientList.js
Web_page.css

This implementation:

Adds a new endpoint in the backend (/ingredient-source-details/) that:

Accepts parameters about the ingredient and source
Returns relevant supply chain data including export country, contract end date, and more
Makes updated calculations for the contract end date based on payment delay
Updates the IngredientList component to:

Connect to the backend API
Fetch ingredient details when the Edit button is clicked
Update form fields with the retrieved data
Show loading states during API requests
Handle and display API errors
Re-fetch when cashPaymentDelay changes to get updated contract end date
Adds new CSS styles for:

Displaying the contract end date
Error messages
Loading states
With these changes, when you click the Edit button, the system will automatically fill in data from the Supply Chain API, including country, tariff information, and other relevant fields. When you adjust the cash payment delay, it will recalculate and update the contract end date.
